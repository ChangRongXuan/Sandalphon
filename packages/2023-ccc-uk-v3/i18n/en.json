From my wheelchair, I can see the robot-assisted arms of the Da Vinci surgical system, which Dr. Huang, one of the best urologists in the country, and his team will use to perform my prostatectomy. I asked a uniformed staffer if I could play Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries during the surgery; she grinned but hinted I could only listen to it before entering the ward. Once the anesthesia was injected, I was out within seconds. Six hours later, I was in my hospital bed in excruciating pain. Behind me, on the wall, were pictures of my kids in Austria and their drawings with colorful hearts and get-well-soon letters.\n\nI looked at the multiple bloody scars across my numb, swollen stomach with disbelief. To ease the agonizing pain, an IV pole with a small dose of morphine stood next to my bed. When I reached my pain threshold, I would squeeze the button. Then I had to wait ten minutes for the next fix, no matter how tortured I felt!\n\nOccasionally, patients moaned, and nurses pushed carts across the hall. Otherwise the night was dreadfully still but for the tick of the second hand of the clock on the wall, each echoing louder than the one before. I stuffed my ears with wet tissues, knocked myself out with another fix of painkiller. In the wee hours of the morning, I woke up after coughing and there was a sharp, stabbing sensation on my belly. It was March 4. On the same day in 2022, the year before, I had arrived in Ukraine to document the invasion of Ukraine, an innocent landscape despoiled by Russia. I wished I were there now.\n\nTwo months after surgery and recovery, I finally returned to Graz, Austria, where I have lived since getting married and becoming a parent, to make up for the lost time with my kids. In addition, I gradually exercised to regain stamina. Despite reminders from my doctors and fellow prostate cancer survivors not to carry heavy stuff over three kilos, I walked regularly with a bulletproof vest equipped with level-four armored plates. That’s about nine kilos. Finally, with “fit-to-travel” permission from my urologist in Austria, I arrived in Kyiv on June 4.\n\nThe first Sunday of June in the capital was bright and blue even though it had been under attack from ballistic cruise missiles and Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze drones. My friend who saw the Patriot air defense system intercepting the incoming missiles warned me not to take pictures of intercepts. One day in May, thirty-two individuals who posted pictures or videos of the Patriot intercepting Russian missiles on social media, were arrested. They were forced to make confessions and apologies on TV and on the social media site Telegram with their faces blurred. \n\nThe country has been living with a palpable sense of tension and unease since the Russia’s full-scaled invasion in February 2022. Under martial law, heightened security measures and constant vigilance are everywhere. Any slight suspicious move will be reported and investigated by the Ukraine State’s Secret Services (SBU.) I know that for a fact!\n\nBack in the late afternoon of March 2022, I heard a high-pitched, piercing whistle moving in the air towards me. The swoosh became higher in pitch. I looked up and it was an eight-meter Kalibr cruise missile. Then another one, both whizzing over my head, the sound died down as it receded, and then seconds later, they struck an oil depot outside the city. The rumbling explosions thumped the earth as an impenetrable mushroom cloud billowed into the air. The wind carried it further spread, darkened and suffocated the beautiful historical city of Lviv. Meanwhile, fire engines and police vehicles, wailing, converged on the engulfed depot. I rushed up to a nearby hilltop of the landmark Lychakiv Cemetery to take pictures. \n\nAs I held my breath and looked through the viewfinder, I could also sense in my peripheral vision that onlookers were sizing me up suspiciously. Before I knew what was happening, a man in his mid-30s with a black baseball cap ran up the hill. Then another two men, in dark windbreakers, black jeans, baseball caps and sling pouches, hurried up. In less than a minute, I was boxed in! I raised both arms but the first order was turn around with both hands on the guard rails and remain absolutely still. I could see something protruding from one of the men’s lower right windbreaker pocket. It’s probably either a walkie-talkie or a pistol, I thought. An hour-long body search examined every pore and between my every finger and toe. Every picture and all the phone records, including WhatsApp, Telegram and Messenger from the previous hours and days were questioned and verified: “Who is Marta? Girlfriend?” “No.” “Who is Igor, is he Russian?” “A photographer friend from Kharkiv.” “Why are you keeping receipts? Are you CIA?” “No!” “Mossad?” “No!”\n\nIt was getting dark and chilly. I was finally allowed to put on my socks upon the somewhat satisfactory completion of the interrogation. As I looked around, all the onlookers had already disappeared. It was just me and three baseball-capped, dark-clothed men, all with identical hair-cuts. There was still audible murmuring and the blaring and wailing far away. \n\nI might have been perceived as an informer taking pictures and providing coordinates for Russia. Being cooperative as I was searched and truthfully answering every question, was my only  chance to prove my innocence. I later related the event to a friend with NATO, and he said I was lucky to have an Asian face, or I could have been mopped on the ground before questioning! I hurried back to my hotel just before the curfew started, had a shot of leftover Polish vodka from Krakow and phoned up my fixer—who supposedly was smoothing my way—with one sentence: “You’re fired.”\n\nThis latest was my fifth trip to Ukraine since the invasion. My only objective in Kyiv was to catch up with colleagues over beer and to pick up my new press credential. I was planning to leave for Donbas the next day. Then I realized that the accreditation application from my agency, Magnum Photos in Paris, to the Ukraine Ministry of Defense (MOD) in Kyiv had been lost in the digital abyss. A major hiccup! I had no choice but to reapply right there and right away. I was told that there were a thousand-plus applicants ahead of me all queuing up for approval. And I was further told that it’s an “immovable process” that requires three to four weeks. It’s not up to the MOD but the SBU for the final approval. I cannot clarify how I jumped the line to get my press card. I am forever grateful to friends in high places for expediting the process!\n\nIt was a smooth drive from Kyiv to Dnipro via Highway M03 with my fixer, Evhen; no air alerts and no checkpoints. But once we were headed towards Pokrovsk in Donbas, drab olive-green military vehicles were zooming by in both directions. We slowed down and stopped at checkpoints newly-reinforced with concrete blocks. More often than not, when a policeman with a Kalashnikov rifle checked my passport and press card, my fixer would joke, “Jackie Chan!” And that often was an immediate ice breaker with grins and laughter. With my right fist clenched, I would respond by saying, “Jackie Chan stands with Ukraine,” although I do not think that Jackie Chan would ever have the gall to say that. Not in this life!\n\nThe war’s impact on life in Ukraine is just as incomprehensible as it is lasting. Since the illegal and immoral invasion, every Ukrainian has families and friends fighting in the war as well as displaced, domestically or overseas. Ukraine will face gigantic problems after the war. But for now, the main goal is to win the war and to liberate the land that belongs to Ukraine. \n\nThe long-anticipated counteroffensive has been silently and cautiously under way on the eastern and southern fronts to puncture Russia’s defenses. Russia had spent months fortifying their lines with anti-tank ditches, vast minefields, concrete “dragon’s teeth,” iron “hedgehogs,” intricate infantry trenches, barbed-wired fences and artillery. Every square meter gained will require a slow and grinding battle. \n\nUkraine will need time, will, lives and a lot of firepower to launch a full-scale counteroffensive. I was with the 59th brigade artillery unit equipped with GRAD, a multiple rocket launcher system. Some forty rockets were loaded on the truck with four soldiers standing by, all camouflaged in the woods, ready for the firing order from the command center. Once a target had been confirmed, they would drive to the position, adjust the coordinates and fire within minutes. The commander would confirm whether the target had been hit or not. Then another two or three rockets could be fired before they swiftly relocated under another tree line lest they too be targeted and take return fire. It’s all “shoot and scoot,” but also to conserve ammo. I was quite near the firing rockets, and so, not just the sound, but the shock wave penetrated my body. I covered my ears and kept my mouth open to balance the pressure.\n\nWe were all told to switch our phones to Airplane mode before reaching front line positions. The only connection was via Starlink. A soldier from the 72nd brigade told me that the Russian soldiers were just behind the tree line about a kilometer away from where we stood. We were on the so-called Zero Line. As we moved around a dark, damp, dense and mazelike trench, it was more than clear: “If you want to live, dig!” The soldiers in the trenches are to hold the position with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, AK rifles and Javelins, no matter what!\n\nLater, I was embedded with a platoon that would operate drone attacks on Russian trenches and high-value targets, such as tanks, Armored personnel carriers (APCs) or artillery weapon systems. The choice of weapon has been the modified DJI Mavic 3 Pro with a 40mm grenade attached underneath. From inside a reinforced trench within the command center, we watch the drone’s movement on the tablet. Sunlight  shines through cracks in the wood and the holes of camouflage nets. Mosquitos, flies and bees buzz in and out of the trenches.\n\nThree Russian soldiers without T-shirts were spotted digging trenches under some fallen twigs and leaves. The drone was hovering right above them. I was thinking that they were going to die. The grenade dropped but did not explode. The drone returned to base to mount another grenade and took off again for the mission! It all looked like another video clip of war until the connection with the drone was lost. The drone operator was disheartened. He reset over and over again to try to reconnect the drone, but by then the drone had been intercepted or shot down by Russia. \n\nWe could see all the Russian frontline positions from high above, and so could they see us. Did they spot me when I was taking a leak in the woods on the frontline? Were those annoying buzzes those of wasps skimming around? Or a deadly drone hovering above me? There was no explosion that afternoon! I got to live another day to document the war.\n\nNazzri, a politician with no fighting experience before the war, has been a battle-hardened war hero, and is the commander of the unit I was embedded with. He told me that a three-thousand USD Mavic Pro drone may last for a week. He’s been quite public and popular on social media, but it scares me to travel with his convoy, especially during the hours of daylight; there is a fifty-thousand USD bounty on him, dead or alive. \n\nThrough an encrypted app, I arranged to meet Yuri in the only pizzeria in Pokrovsk. He is a retired American career soldier from California and has been devotedly fighting for Ukraine since the spring of 2022. He’s low-key, down to earth and soft-spoken, occasionally scanning his sectors during the lunch. He didn’t resemble the fighter I saw on viral drone footage of a QRF (quick reaction force) mission, in which he was charging on the lead Humvee, assaulting a Russian position with a machine gun at close range. The moment the fighters jumped out of the Humvees, they were already in auto-pilot mode, with a killer’s instinct. It’s either shoot or be shot, kill or be killed. All the training is to make a soldier into a fighter to kill the enemy. I asked Yuri his opinion of the ongoing Chinese aircraft sorties on Taiwan Strait. He replied firmly, “You guys should know better and be prepared for the attack.”\n\nI recall there was a New York Times editorial in mid-April this year, written by a former Taiwan minister of culture. It was nicely written but clearly by someone without common sense. It was as if organized gangsters were brandishing daggers and machetes before an innocent civilian’s front yard every day, and the homeowner, despite being bullied repeatedly and threatened by deadly weapons, should just bow to defuse and de-escalate the situation. \n\nAs for the jointly signed antiwar statement by the Taiwan scholars a month before that, it seems that the eggheads have comfortably dwelt in an ivory tower for too long. They live away from the practicalities and complexities of the real world, hindering their empathy and a holistic understanding of societal issues. \n\nI have my feet on the ground. I don’t view the world from on high, from a metaphorical tower full of PhDs. What would a PhD do if his or her house were about to be attacked by organized gangsters? I don’t know, but I think, first of all, that he or she should jettison the lofty thinking and be connected with the concerns and experiences of ordinary people.\n\nIf there were an imminent threat that my house would be attacked by gangsters, I would first reinforce my house to make it a fortress. Furthermore, I would mobilize and unite a network of friends and relatives to fight back!\n\nDivided, we fall. United, we stand. In the spring of 2022, NATO and the U.S., were wishy-washy (they still are, I might add!) regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and dawdling about instituting sanctions. The rest of the world was masked up and locked down due to the virus spread from Wuhan, China. Foreign assistance was thin. But I remember a Ukrainian friend telling me that if Russian tanks roared in to Kyiv, there would be Kalashnikov rifles and Molotov cocktails out of every window and aiming at each tank.\n\nIf I don’t take the initiative to protect my home and loved ones, how can I expect any help, domestic or foreign? I don’t kowtow to appease or surrender to an organized mafia. \n\nIs an attack far-fetched? It would have seemed so for most of the Ukrainians before February 24, 2022. Who could have imagined the devastation and destruction on the front-line towns and the shelling of villages and cities far away from the frontline?\n\nRaisa, a 53th brigade press officer, took me to Avdiivka, which is two to three kilometers from the frontline, flanked by Russian troops from the north, the south and the east. Here, there are no air alerts to warn citizens of imminent missile attacks, because there are constant incoming and outgoing rockets, night and day. Every single house, apartment building, kindergarten, school, store, alley and/or road has been destroyed and razed. Not a home, not a life, has been untouched by the Russian invasion. Even though I had been to Ukraine several times earlier in the war, I was unprepared how the hatred Ukrainians feel towards Russian has grown since the invasion.\n\nWe moved swiftly from one pocket of wreckage to another to avoid being detected by the Russian drones. Military trucks with camouflage zoom by, spraying another layer of dirt onto the unexploded rockets on the roadside.\n\nA nearing rumble signaled that an armored ambulance was about to roar in. The engine grumbled and dust shrouded the meeting point where two teams of medics with stretchers had been standing by. In less than a minute, they had transported an injured frontline soldier to another ambulance, en route to a stabilization unit. \n\nThe ambulance driver grabbed his Kalashnikov, slammed the door and sped up. Inside the air-conditioned ambulance, the air was stuffy mixed with chemicals, sweat, and blood stains. The two doctors, in bullet-proof vests with three rifle magazines and helmets, tried to keep the severely injured soldier from bumping up and down as the driver zigzagged through the dirt roads full of potholes. The disoriented soldier’s eyes were full of fear and panic. His tall and heavyset body was covered with shrapnel wounds. His entire left arm was stabilized with splints and wrapped with gauze, but was motionless. Blood was still seeping through the plaster and down to his muddy fingertips. One medic hastily cut open the dark stained fatigues with a pair of shears. His body was already full of chest seal packs to stop the bleeding of multiple wounds. The two doctors used an Israeli abdominal bandage to staunch the wounds. Two tourniquets covered with dirt were already applied near the groin of his left leg after the explosion. What happened on the frontline?! It's hard to fathom that this soldier who risked everything to liberate the land that belongs to his country, could die at any second. Three soldiers I had spent time with in Donbas last August have already sacrificed their lives in battle.\n\nUpon arriving at the boarded-up stabilization unit, the traumatized soldier was rushed into the emergency room. Another team of doctors and nurses with ballistic goggles took over. I asked one of the ambulance doctors if the soldier would survive. He said that the soldier’s fight on the frontlines is over. He will now have to fight for his life in the hospital if he lives. I touched my fading surgery scars thinking of the soldier, if he lives, his scars will be emotional as well as physical.\n\nWhile driving across the country, I remember a friend who described the Ukraine landscape “as flat as pancake.” The vast and ever-changing cloud formation is astonishing and unpredictable. A colleague sent me a Telegram message saying Putin was about to address the nation in 20 minutes regarding the Wagner mutiny. This was the kind of historical event that I will remember where I was and what I was doing. I was reaching Lviv on my way home via Krakow in Poland. In the western part of the Ukraine, there was certainly less destruction but no shortage of despair. I wondered if the mutiny was the start of the end of the war and/or the end of Putin! I also asked myself how the military rebellion would affect China’s continuous armed threat to Taiwan. I don’t know. All I know is do not let your guard down, ever.\n\nA few days after returning to Graz and home with the kids, I heard that Ria Pizza in the center of Kramatorsk was struck by a Russian missile during dinnertime. I couldn’t watch the footage of the dying people screaming for help underneath the rubble—my kids were next to me. But there’s a hole in my heart. I remember the place. I spent two weeks with my colleague Sergey working around Kramatorsk, including Bakhmut, last August. The next day, I received an Interfax news report, a reputable Ukrainian news service in three languages, from a colleague. It stated that SBU “in hot pursuit” detained a spotter activated by Russian military intelligence, who sent a filmed location of the café to Russian intelligence before the missile strike. The detained agent would have to answer before the court for his war crime against humanity! \n\nThe short-lived mutiny ended but the Wagnerian drama lingers. So many unanswered questions. I finally finished editing my pictures. And I continue to exercise and walk along the river with my vest and level-four armored plates, and I could listen to the Ride of Valkyries on my sweaty Air pods. \n\nBut then, all of a sudden, an air alert was on! Ah, yes, it’s the national weekly alert drill, fifty-two times a year. No exception. Just another Saturday noon in Austria.\n"}]},"caption":"Chien-Chi Chang.
